# nlp_experiments

The bert_bot.py is a Q&A using BERT nlp model of google. It accepts a file with a paragraph and answer users question on the basis of it.

The main.py file does the same but with text similarization using cosine_similarity. The difference is BERT gives far better results.

Feel free to edit the files for better.
These are just my random experiments on NLP
